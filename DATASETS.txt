Describe the Data:  The data gives us dozens of metrics that correspond to a single family household with the attributes such as family health, income, cell phone usage, program help, physical disabilities, etc.  From this data we kind find the total condition of health for a family and see what attributes attribute the most to a families health.  There is a column in 3 different data sets from multiple years that is called Household ID’s which might allow us to link records of families over multiple years.

Insights:  We hope to gain insights on what factors relate to a family being overall healthy.  We wanna look at insights such as:  Does having disabilities such as memory loss or inability to walk affect a family’s health,  Does a family having medicare vs private insurance affect a family’s health,  Does cell phone usage lead to memory loss in a family, etc.  There are 3 data sets with matching household ID’s but from separate years so we can see if any changes in attributes attribute to better or worse health over the years.  We would love to learn more about what attributes can help with better health for our own families.  We can now look individual persons inside a family and look how their background such as education level influence the overall family health.  Household lets us link the families tables to the persons table and it allows us to connect a famlies health to a region they live in.  We can now look at the same family, household, and person in the same year of 2011 and look into the overall health of that specific year.
